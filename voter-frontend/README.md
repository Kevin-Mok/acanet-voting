# Voter Frontend & Solidity Testing

## Set Up

The `Ballot.json` inside `src/contract-abis` is the same that exists in the authority frontend. Basically the `.sol` files are compiled in `contracts` and then copied into `voting-authority-backend/solidity/toDeploy` and `voter-frontend/src/contract-abis`

TODO: write up README after dockerization
